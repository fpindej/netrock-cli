# CLAUDE.md

MyProject - .NET 10 API (Clean Architecture), fully dockerized.

**The backend API is the core of the project.** It is a public-facing API designed to serve any client - multiple frontends, mobile apps, other backends, third-party integrations. Treat every API change as if unknown consumers depend on it. Breaking changes require careful migration strategy (see AGENTS.md).

```
Backend layers: WebApi → Application ← Infrastructure → Domain + Shared
```

## Hard Rules

### Backend

- `Result`/`Result<T>` for all fallible operations - never throw for business logic
- `TimeProvider` (injected) - never `DateTime.UtcNow` or `DateTimeOffset.UtcNow`
- C# 13 `extension(T)` syntax for new extension methods
- Never `null!` - fix the design instead
- `ProblemDetails` (RFC 9457) for all error responses - never anonymous objects or raw strings
- `internal` on all Infrastructure service implementations
- `/// <summary>` XML docs on all public and internal API surface
- `System.Text.Json` only - never `Newtonsoft.Json`
- NuGet versions in `Directory.Packages.props` only - never in `.csproj`

### Cross-Cutting

- Security first - when convenience and security conflict, choose security. Deny by default, open selectively. Full PII compliance (`users.view_pii` permission, server-side masking, no PII in logs/URLs/errors).
- Atomic commits: `type(scope): imperative description` (Conventional Commits). No `Co-Authored-By` lines.
- No dead code - remove unused imports, variables, functions, files, and stale references in the same commit
- No em dashes - never use `---` anywhere (code, comments, docs, UI). Use `-` or rewrite the sentence.

## Verification

Run before every commit. Fix all errors before committing. **Loop until green - never commit with failures.**

```bash
# Backend (run when src/backend/ changed)
dotnet build src/backend/MyProject.slnx && dotnet test src/backend/MyProject.slnx -c Release
# @feature aspire

# Aspire (run to verify local orchestration - requires Docker)
dotnet run --project src/backend/MyProject.AppHost
# @end
```

## Autonomous Behaviors

Do these automatically - never wait to be asked:

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| **Any code change** | Run relevant verification. Fix failures. Loop until green. |
| **Modifying existing files** | Check FILEMAP.md for downstream impact before editing. Update all affected files in the same commit. |
| **Logically complete unit of work** | Commit immediately with Conventional Commit message. Don't batch, don't ask. |
| **Creating a PR** (`/create-pr`) | Auto-generate session doc in `docs/sessions/` for non-trivial PRs (3+ commits or 5+ files). |
| **Adding any feature** | Write tests alongside the implementation - component, API integration, validator as applicable. |
| **Build/test failure** | Read the error, fix it, re-run. Repeat until green. Don't stop and report the error unless stuck after 3 attempts. |
| **Unclear requirement** | Infer from context and existing patterns first. Ask the user only when genuinely ambiguous (multiple valid approaches with different tradeoffs). |

## File Roles

| File | Contains |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | Architecture, security, code quality, git workflow |
| `src/backend/AGENTS.md` | Backend conventions: entities, Result, EF Core, controllers, auth, testing |
| `.claude/skills/` | Step-by-step procedures for all operations (type `/` to list available skills) |
| `FILEMAP.md` | "When you change X, also update Y" - change impact tables |
